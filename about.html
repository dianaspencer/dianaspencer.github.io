  <h1>Hey! I'm Dani.</h1>
  <p>
    I enjoy building applications through a human-centered approach.
    I draw inspiration from fields in computational neuroscience,
    software algorithms, design thinking, and even oceanography.
    All the same, I am most excited about understanding the underlying architectures
    needed to build systems that can intelligently interact with the dynamic nature
    of humans, while also maintaining a focus on responsible, safe AI.

    I created this portfolio to help me visualize the pieces of work I am
    proud of and the road I have taken to see them to completion.
    Even though some pieces may be found incomplete,
    this choice is intentional since I perceive learning as an evolutionary process
    and it illustrates my growth track.

    Professionally, I am a machine learning, software engineer, and I'm driven
    to perfect my software craftsmanship. I studied computer science, biology,
    and stumbled into computational neuroscience during my undergrad.
    These years were also exciting for me because I conducted research in oceanography and
    published my first research paper as the first author. I later pursued a master's in
    computational neuroscience and machine learning.
    <br>

    I am open to collaborate with anyone who aligns with my interests and values.
    If you have a question regarding a topic I cover or want to learn more, I'll do my
    best to respond soon. A well thought out message typically gets a quicker reply.
