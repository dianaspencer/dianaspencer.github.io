From a developer's perspective, building on a project with very little
direct communication to the customer and understanding the customer's
journey feels like moving through an obstacle course with a blindfold
over your eyes. The experience exactly encapsulates the role of a code monkey.
The feeling is one-dimensional without a sense of empathy for the person
using the software system. But I have taken notice many developers forget
who they are building for: humans. I suppose since customer interactions
are only conducted by product mangers and/or anyone who has a title that
says "I talk to customers", then perhaps this brings about a culture where
developers are justified to be tucked away in a corner office.

But what if the ordinary developer were trained in design thinking ways.
Would it improve code literacy within a team and as a consequence increase
higher quality deliveries and high delivery throughput because the right
questions are addressed sooner? Can design thinking supplement developers
the confidence to pitch ideas which directly influence the potential of a
software to improve all users' well-being? I would assume so since we are the
makers of the product and have full control of the internal outcome. The people
who write the code know best the internal workings of the product, irregardless
of their fancy title within a company.

Beyond practicing better software craftsmanship, I am curious to apply design
thinking to my projects in software development, and heck, to all aspects in
my work as I focus onward for the betterment of myself, the teams I collaborate
with, and the society at large. What kind of impact would a developer contribute
to a team if they practiced a human-centered mindset and asked more pointed
questions towards the user experience?

This post marks the first in a series of: What would happen if developers trained
