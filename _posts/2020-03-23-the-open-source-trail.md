#### Open source code is everywhere :earth_africa:

As a software engineer that has worked in a young tech company, I have witnessed
how the fast-paced development of a product highly depends on the
open source community. This can be said for almost every tech start-up
in the year 2020.

Without having libraries openly available I suspect development cycles for new features would run
at a snails pace.  Businesses would lose time and money reinventing
the wheel for niche libraries another team or company had already
mastered.  Innovations in technology stacks would lose creativity from
different people coming together.  But I don't have to
convince you of this, because you are already know given the plethora of
resources promoting open source.

> In real open source, you have the right to control your own destiny.
> Linus Torvalds

Linus, inventor of the Linux kernal, paints the open source landscape
with freedom and expressivity of taking abstract ideas and giving them impactful
meaning. This is why for me contributing to open source as a developer is important.
It is a gateway for me to contribute to causes I deeply care about.
